A Telegram Bot which records instagram names dropped during a certain timeframe and then posts a complete list of these names at the end of the timeframe to the users in the group. Every 5 minutes, it notifies users who have not yet replied to the bot with “Done [username]”. At the end of the hour, any user who hasn’t replied to the bot with “Done [username]” is given a warning.
